                Welcome.
My name is Ken Alcala, a 21-year-old student from Cavite State University - Bacoor Campus, currently pursuing BS Computer Science as 3rd Year.
I am a quiet yet determined individual who values growth, honesty, and creativity. I enjoy learning new things and expressing myself.
I came from a simple, loving family. My parents have always supported my dreams, and they taught me the value of hard work and respect.
